                                    <h6>1. Community Amenities</h6>
<p>
The most desirable feature of a home may not be inside the home at all. Some homebuyers may appreciate a governing body like a homeowner's association (HOA). While HOAs may not be for everyone, they offer enhanced security, ground maintenance and numerous community amenities for those who may benefit from additional structure. For buyers considering HOAs, it is critical that they carefully review all documentation. - Fiona Petrie, RE/MAX INTEGRA
</p>
<h6>2. Location</h6>
<p>
The three most important things for any real estate property have always been location, location and location. It's no surprise that for buyers, the most important feature is the neighborhood location of a home. That's the one feature they can't change. Buyers can add a bathroom, update a kitchen or put in all new flooring. But the home's location? That will always be the No. 1 feature for buyers. - Kevin Hawkins, WAV Group, Inc.

<h6>3. Great Schools In The Area</h6>
<p>
Proximity to great schools is a significant deciding factor for homebuyers. A beautiful home in a poor school district will not fetch as high a premium as a fixer-upper across the street from a top-rated school. - Spencer Hilligoss, Madison Investing
</p>
<h6>4. Flexible Space</h6>
<p>
Having an extra bedroom is at the top of many homebuyers' wish lists. With an increase in home-based businesses and the desire to have a dedicated space for a playroom or a home gym, the extra bedroom provides flexibility for homebuyers to use it how they see fit for their lifestyle needs. - Michelle Risi, Royal LePage Connect Realty
</p>
<h6>5. Updated Kitchen</h6>
<p>
A key feature buyers look for is having an updated kitchen with high-end cabinets, countertops and appliances. Other important things people look for when buying a home include a very large master closet and a large lot size with a private backyard. - Bruce McNeilage, Kinloch Partners
</p>
<h6>6. A Large Yard</h6>
<p>
Most buyers love a home with a large yard. They can envision their kids (or pets) playing in it, entertaining guests, gardening or even adding onto the house if there's enough room. The possibilities are endless and it's a huge selling point in any home. Buyers also realize that the true value in a property is the land. At the end of the day, all those upgrades inside the home will depreciate. - Brad Le, Compass
</p>
<h6>7. High-End Finishes</h6>
<p>
Buying a home is usually the biggest purchase most families make. Therefore, many decisions go into the decision-making process. Probably the most common is price point. In terms of features, buyers usually want high-end finishes, including a large master ensuite bathroom. Some will choose a less expensive home so that they can remodel and add high-end finishes to the kitchen and baths. - Timmi Ryerson, Smart Property Systems - Property Management
</p>
<h6>8. A Garage</h6>
<p>
You don't realize how important it is until you don't have one, but you have got to have a garage. Even though some people don't park their cars in the garage, they can use it for storage. I saw a friend convert his garage into a man cave, but the property sold for $200k less than the market comp three years later. I’ve even seen a flipped home with carports instead of a garage that ended up sitting on the market for months. - Jason Hsiao, Shaw Investments
</p>
<h6>9. Smart Home Technology</h6>
<p>
Smart home technology is gaining ground. Homebuyers are looking for the latest smart home technology to control their energy costs, make communication with their loved ones easier or just simply secure their home with new features that allow you to control and program your settings remotely. - Nancy Wallace- Laabs, KBN Homes, LLC
</p>
<h6>10. Open Living Space</h6>
<p>
For the last several years, buyers seem to be gravitating toward a larger kitchen that is open to a living space, either a family or living room. Segmented spaces are a turnoff. Open spaces usually provide more natural light and allow for the homeowners to be together and feel more connected. - Ryan Moran, Option Realty Group
</p>
<h6>11. Logical Design And Layout</h6>
<p>
Flooring, paint and other cosmetic upgrades are easy fixes. However, changing the layout of a home is not. A home with a good bedroom-to-bathroom ratio, spacing between the bedrooms, decent-sized bedrooms and good natural light in all or most areas of the home are features that most can appreciate. I've noticed that new home builders who keep these features in mind have been the most successful. - Catherine Kuo, Elite Homes | Christie's International Real Estate
</p>
<h6>12. Legal Flexibility</h6>
<p>
You buy an apartment, only to find out later when your company offers you an opportunity abroad that your co-op building has restrictions on renting out the apartment you just bought. Many customers value having the option to rent out the space they invested in, but they often forget to check if their building allows it at the time of purchase. - Rodolfo Delgado, Replay Listings
</p>
<h6>13. Convenience</h6>
<p>
These days, convenience is a huge factor when buyers are purchasing a home. This includes a convenient location when compared to work, school and entertainment, along with easy upkeep for the property itself. These conveniences are making homeownership a bit easier, which is important these days. - Mike Hambright, FlipNerd.com
</p>
<h6>14. Accessory Dwelling Units</h6>
<p>
One thing we are seeing a lot of in California—and across the country—is the desire for an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) or the space to build one. This can make highly priced areas actually cost buyers less since they can either accommodate multigenerational families or generate revenue through renting. And now with recent law changes, they’re even easier to build! - Jennifer Anderson, Anderson Coastal Group
</p>
<h6>15. Value</h6>
<p>
Value is the No. 1 feature today's homebuyers most desire, but value can also be very subjective. Be it a great price/sq ft ratio, a top school district or even a fix-and-flip opportunity, value is the key metric most homebuyers have in mind, and it varies with each prospective buyer. It's critical for sellers to make abundantly clear all of the key value propositions that their home offers buyers. - Garratt Hasenstab, The Mountain Life Companies™</p>                          </div><!-- .entry-desc -->
